# Darkflow Object Detection

This is an extension of the [poor-mans-deep-learning-camera](https://github.com/burningion/poor-mans-deep-learning-camera.git) by [@burningion](https://github.com/burningion).

What I've done is added some setup instructions along with some configuration options for flexibility when deploying.
